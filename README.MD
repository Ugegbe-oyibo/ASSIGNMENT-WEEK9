# SUMMARY OF FUNCTIONS
# A function, also known as a reusable code, is a block of code which performs a specific task.
# Its outstanding feature is that it can be called/invoked.
# It is defined by the FUNCTION keyword, a name (this is what it is called with) and a parenthesis. The parenthesis houses the parameter(s). The code to be executed is placed inside cujrly brackets.

# SUMMARY OF ARRAY
# An array is essentially a list. It is a variable that can hold more than one value and can hold different data types. Arrays are created by using the const keyword (this is not compulsory but its common practice) and giving it a name, followed by assignment (=) and then, putting the items in a block bracket ([]). Array elements can be accessed by using the index number (this statrts from 0 with the first item being 0 and the second being 1, etc). 
# It has some properties like the LENGTH property that is used to return the length of the array, the POP property removes an item/element from the back, the SHIFT targets a specific item to removed by using the index number while the PUSH adds to it from the back, etc.

# CONTROL FLOW STATEMENT SUMMARY
# These allows us control how statements are executed in a program. It includes 
# The IF/ELSE statement: this is like a criteria being met. It allows a block of code to be executed if a certain criteria is met and another code to be executed if the said criteria is not met.
# LOOPS: this is like a circle that does not break until a certain condition is met. For instance, you could ask a certain variable to keep increasing until it is equal to a certain number. The code keeps running until that certain criteria is met and then, it breaks.
